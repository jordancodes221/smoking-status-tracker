# smoking-status-tracker-desktop-app
While I worked for a family health team, there was an initiative to update every patient's smoking status. Healthcare providers were originally manually tallying the results. So, I created a desktop application that allowed them to track the results.

While the original project relied on the electronic medical records, this project allows a hypothetical healthcare provider to manually enter each patient's smoking status and view the statistics on the data they entered.
